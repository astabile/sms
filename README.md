# sms
Create a site that allows someone to enter in a cell phone number and send an SMS message to that number. When the recipient receives the message from the sender, they should be asked a series of questions from a chatbot. The responses to these questions should be recorded in a database and also displayed on a website (the same one that the user sent the message from)
